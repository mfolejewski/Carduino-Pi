# Carduino Pi - Raspberry Pi RP2040 board with business card form factor and compatible with Arduino Uno

## Description
Carduino Pi is a Raspberry Pi RP2040 evaluation board with business card form factor and compatible with Arduino Uno standard, which has features, as following:
- PCB dimensions: 85,60 x 54,00 mm (ultra flat design, only 0.8mm components height),
- all 30 GPIO pins connected to pin header (Arduino Uno standard with extra 8 GPIO pins),
- 2-layer PCB board,
- onboard: QSPI Flash (USON8 package), 12MHz oscillator, PWR LED,
- RESET/BOOT switches,
- USB interface (PCB edge connector) for debugging MCU and for flashing SPI memory,
- 8x ring LED RGB (WS2812-2020 diodes), 
- fully open source project (OSHW).

The equation is very simple:
Business Card + Arduino + Raspberry Pi RP2040 = Carduino Pi
